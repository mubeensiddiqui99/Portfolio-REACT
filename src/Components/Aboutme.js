    <p> <em>Im a hard working and dedicated professional front-end developer/user interface designer with a keen eye for detail, and a determination to deliver the very highest quality. I take great pride in my work, and I always try to better myself with every project I work on.

I like to write semantic, cross browser compatible code by hand that is re-useable, maintainable and easy to understand.

I am motivated, enthusiastic and well organised, with a keen eye for beautiful design, primarily based around user interfaces.

The main areas of my expertise are HTML(5), CSS(3), Bootstrap, JavaScript (native and jQuery) , React Js and WordPress </em> </p>
